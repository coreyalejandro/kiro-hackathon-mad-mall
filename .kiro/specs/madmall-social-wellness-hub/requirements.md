# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MADMall Social Wellness Hub (AIme) is a non-medical, therapeutic, culturally grounded online mall and social network designed specifically for Black women living with Graves' Disease. The platform combines the familiar metaphor of a digital mall with community support, identity affirmation, humor, and wellness resources. The system will provide a safe space for sisterhood, peer support, and stress relief while incorporating a sophisticated Titan Data Engine that analyzes engagement patterns to predict optimal feature development and generate publishable Models of Care for healthcare providers.

The platform emphasizes cultural safety, therapeutic value without medical intervention, and data-driven insights to continuously improve the user experience and inform broader healthcare approaches.
