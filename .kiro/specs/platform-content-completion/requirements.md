# Platform Content Completion Requirements

## Introduction

The MADMall platform currently has hero sections implemented for all pages but is missing the core content sections that make the platform functional. This spec addresses the critical gap between the visual foundation and the actual user-facing features needed for demonstrations, vendor meetings, and beta testing.

The platform must transition from "hero-only" pages to fully functional sections with realistic synthetic data, interactive features, and seamless user experiences that demonstrate the complete vision of a digital wellness mall for Black women.
