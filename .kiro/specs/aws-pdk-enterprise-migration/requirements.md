# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration of the existing MADMall social wellness platform from a traditional React/Express architecture to an enterprise-grade AWS Project Development Kit (PDK) monorepo. The migration will transform the current hackathon-style codebase into a production-ready, scalable, and maintainable system leveraging cutting-edge AWS services and modern development practices.

The migration targets a complete architectural overhaul while preserving all existing functionality, ensuring zero downtime during transition, and establishing a foundation for rapid enterprise-scale development.
