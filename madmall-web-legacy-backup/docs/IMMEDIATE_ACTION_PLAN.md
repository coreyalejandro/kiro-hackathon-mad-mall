  escalateToAdvisoryBoard(imageId: string): Promise<ReviewRequest>
  implementCommunityDecisions(): Promise<void>
}
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)
```typescript
// Smart selection and optimization
interface SmartImageSystem {
  selectForContext(context: UsageContext): Promise<OptimalImage>
  personalizeForUser(userId: string): Promise<PersonalizedImages>
  optimizePerformance(): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>
  analyzeEngagement(): Promise<EngagementInsights>
}
```
