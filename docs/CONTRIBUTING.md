## Contributing to MADMall

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project uses a monorepo powered by pnpm.

### Quick start
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Start the dev environment: `pnpm run dev`
3. Run tests: `pnpm test`

### Ways to contribute
- Report bugs using the Feedback issue template
- Propose features and designs via an OR Pull Request (RFC)
- Improve docs, tests, and developer experience

### OR-PR (RFC) process
- For non-trivial or user-facing changes, open a PR labeled `rfc`
- Fill out the RFC template, outlining motivation, design, risks, and alternatives
- Keep the PR open for at least 7 days for community input
- If the change is high-impact or sensitive, add the `advisory-needed` label to request Advisory Board input (up to 14 days)

### Pull requests
- Prefer small, focused PRs with clear descriptions and checklists
- Link related issues and Discussions
- Add tests and docs for new behavior
- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages when possible (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)

### Code style and quality
- Follow TypeScript strictness in tsconfig
- Keep functions small and well-named; write high-clarity code
- Run lints and tests locally before opening or updating PRs

### Communication
- Use Discussions for open-ended ideas and community calls
- Use Issues for bugs and actionable tasks
- Be respectful and follow our `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
