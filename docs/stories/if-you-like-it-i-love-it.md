# If You Like It, I Love It

*A story by Mary Ann D.*

The day I was diagnosed with Graves' disease was the same day I found out I was pregnant with my first child. Talk about a plot twist! I remember sitting in that doctor's office, trying to process two life-changing pieces of information at once.

"Your thyroid is overactive," the doctor said, "and you're about eight weeks pregnant."

I looked at my husband, then back at the doctor. "Is that... is that okay? Can I have both?"

What followed was a whirlwind of appointments, specialists, and a crash course in managing an autoimmune condition while growing a human. Some days I felt like I could conquer the world - the hyperthyroid energy was real. Other days, I was so exhausted I could barely get out of bed.

The hardest part wasn't the physical symptoms, though. It was the fear. Fear that I wouldn't be able to carry my baby to term. Fear that the medication would hurt my child. Fear that I was somehow broken.

But you know what I learned? Our bodies are incredibly resilient. With the right medical team, careful monitoring, and a lot of self-compassion, I carried my daughter to full term. She's three now, healthy and brilliant, and she has no idea that her mama was fighting an invisible battle while she was growing.

The pregnancy actually helped my Graves' disease go into remission - something that happens for about 30% of women. My doctor called it a "pregnancy gift." I called it a miracle.

Now, when I see newly diagnosed sisters, especially those dealing with pregnancy or trying to conceive, I want them to know: it's possible. It's not easy, but it's possible. Your body is not broken. You are not broken. You're just learning a new way to be strong.

If you're reading this and you're scared, that's okay. I was scared too. But fear doesn't have to be the end of the story. Sometimes it's just the beginning of discovering how much stronger you are than you ever imagined.

And if you like this story, well... I love that it might help someone else feel a little less alone.
