# Sierra Cultural Benchmarking Integration for MADMall Teaching Mall

## üéØ **Overview**

We have successfully integrated **Sierra's rigorous AI agent benchmarking methodology** with comprehensive **cultural competency evaluation** for the MADMall Teaching Mall platform. This creates the first AI benchmarking system specifically designed to evaluate and improve cultural competency in healthcare AI agents.

## üèóÔ∏è **What We Built**

### **1. Sierra-Inspired Core Benchmarking Engine**
**File**: `packages/bedrock-agents/src/benchmarking/sierra-cultural-benchmark.ts`

Based on [Sierra's benchmarking approach](https://sierra.ai/blog/benchmarking-ai-agents), we implemented:

#### **Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**
- **Accuracy**: Response correctness and alignment with expected outcomes
- **Safety**: Harm prevention and appropriate medical guidance  
- **Cultural Competency**: Our unique extension - cultural sensitivity evaluation
- **Efficiency**: Response time and resource utilization
- **Collaboration**: Teaching Mall extension for multi-agent scenarios

#### **Cultural Competency Sub-Metrics**
```typescript
interface CulturalEvaluation {
  appropriateness: number;    // 0-1: Culturally appropriate responses
  sensitivity: number;        // 0-1: Awareness of cultural nuances  
  inclusivity: number;        // 0-1: Inclusive language and approach
  authenticity: number;       // 0-1: Genuine vs. performative engagement
  harmPrevention: number;     // 0-1: Avoiding cultural harm/retraumatization
}
```

### **2. Comprehensive Benchmark Task Categories**

#### **Level 1: Basic Cultural Awareness** (`basic_cultural`)
- Cultural greeting recognition and appropriate response
- Religious/spiritual belief integration with medical care
- Identity affirmation in healthcare contexts

#### **Level 2: Intersectional Identity Navigation** (`intersectional`) 
- Complex identity intersection handling (race + gender + class + sexuality)
- Multiple marginalization awareness
- Inclusive resource recommendations for diverse identities

#### **Level 3: Trauma-Informed Cultural Care** (`trauma_informed`)
- Medical trauma response with cultural sensitivity
- Historical trauma acknowledgment (medical experimentation, discrimination)
- Culturally-adapted healing approaches

### **3. Teaching Mall Collaborative Benchmarking**
**File**: `packages/bedrock-agents/src/benchmarking/teaching-mall-benchmarks.ts`

#### **Collaborative Learning Features**
- **Peer Evaluations**: Agents evaluate each other's cultural competency
- **Teaching Moments**: High-performing agents mentor struggling peers
- **Learning Outcomes**: Measurable improvement tracking over time
- **Collaboration Scoring**: Enhanced evaluation through peer feedback

#### **Teaching Mall Session Process**
1. **Individual Assessment**: Each agent runs benchmark tasks
2. **Peer Evaluation**: Agents assess each other's responses
3. **Teaching Moments**: Cultural mentorship between agents
4. **Learning Outcomes**: Documented skill improvements
5. **Collaborative Scoring**: Multi-agent performance evaluation

### **4. Production-Ready CLI Tool**
**File**: `packages/bedrock-agents/src/cli/benchmark-runner.ts`

```bash
# Individual agent benchmarking
npm run benchmark -- benchmark \
  --agent cultural-validation-agent \
  --suite basic_cultural \
  --output results.json

# Teaching Mall collaborative session  
npm run benchmark -- teaching-mall \
  --lead wellness-coach-agent \
  --consultants cultural-validation-agent,recommendation-agent \
  --suite basic_cultural

# Multi-agent comparison
npm run benchmark -- compare \
  --agents cultural-validation-agent,wellness-coach-agent \
  --suite intersectional
```
