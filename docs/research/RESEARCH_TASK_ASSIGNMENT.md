## üìû **Assignment Confirmation**

**Gemini (Experimental Data Lead)**: URGENT research assignment - please confirm receipt and provide:

1. **Immediate start** - 1 hour completion required
2. **LangGraph setup** with Google LangExtract installation
3. **Jupyter notebook creation** in this repo (following our previous collaboration pattern)
4. **Automated research pipeline** for Black women + Graves' disease literature

**Reference Previous Work**: Look for the other Jupyter notebook you did with me previously for collaboration pattern.

**This research will form the foundation for our evidence-based cultural competency framework and demonstrate to judges that we're building on established research rather than creating frameworks from scratch.**
