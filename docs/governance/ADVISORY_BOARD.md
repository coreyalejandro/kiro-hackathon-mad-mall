## Advisory Board Charter

The Advisory Board provides non-binding guidance on strategy, ethics, safety, risk, and high-impact technical changes for MADMall. It strengthens community feedback without slowing day-to-day development.

### Responsibilities
- Review OR-PRs labeled `advisory-needed` and provide written recommendations within 14 days
- Advise on roadmap priorities, user safety, and responsible AI/ML practices
- Surface risks, fairness considerations, and long-term maintainability concerns
- Participate in quarterly review meetings; publish short public notes

### Composition and eligibility
- 5â€“9 members from industry, academia, and user communities
- No single employer may hold more than 2 seats at a time
- Members agree to the Code of Conduct and a conflict-of-interest policy

### Terms
- 1-year terms, renewable once (maximum 2 consecutive terms)
- Chair (facilitates) and Secretary (notes) elected annually by the board

### Selection and rotation
- Maintainers solicit nominations prior to term start; self-nominations welcome
- Selection criteria include expertise, lived experience, and viewpoint diversity
- Vacancies may be filled mid-term via the same criteria

### Operating procedures
- Reviews: Board comments directly on `advisory-needed` PRs; summary captured in the PR description
- Meetings: Quarterly, agenda published in Discussions one week prior; minutes published within one week after
- Quorum: Simple majority of seated members; recommendations by majority of attendees
- Confidentiality: Public by default; sensitive matters may be summarized at high level

### Conflict of interest
Members disclose relevant affiliations on each review. When materially conflicted, they recuse from recommendations on that item.

### Removal
Maintainers may remove members for repeated non-participation, violations of the Code of Conduct, or undisclosed conflicts.

### Charter changes
Changes to this charter require an OR-PR labeled `rfc` and are ratified by maintainers after community review. The board may submit a joint statement on proposed changes.
